This program is meant to make the process of collecting the different filters from AIJ Excel spreadsheets faster.
The user enters however many nights they have and the program goes through and checks those text files for the
different columns for,HJD, Amag, and Amag error for the B and V filters.

There are error catching statements within the program so if the user mistypes, the program will not crash and
close on them (hopefully)
